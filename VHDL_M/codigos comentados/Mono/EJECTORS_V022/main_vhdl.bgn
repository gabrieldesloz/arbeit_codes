INFO:Bitgen:40 - Replacing "Auto" with "NoWait" for option "Match_cycle".  Most
   commonly, bitgen has determined and will use a specific value instead of the
   generic command-line value of "Auto".  Alternately, this message appears if
   the same option is specified multiple times on the command-line.  In this
   case, the option listed last will be used.

INFO:PhysDesignRules:772 - To achieve optimal frequency synthesis performance
   with the CLKFX and CLKFX180 outputs of the DCM comp DCM_inst, consult the
   device Interactive Data Sheet.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:549 - Unexpected DCM programming. For DCM comp DCM_inst,
   when the CLKFX or CLKFX180 pins are used the CLKIN_PERIOD attribute must be
   specified in order to achieve optimal performance.
DRC detected 0 errors and 45 warnings.  Please see the previously displayed
individual error or warning messages for more details.

WARNING:Bitgen:242 - CLKIN_PERIOD is set to 0 ps which is less than the minimum
   of 2000 ps. The CLKIN_PERIOD is the period of the input clock to the DCM. The
   CLKIN_PERIOD is used by the DCM for frequency synthesis. To set the
   CLKIN_PERIOD in the UCF use the syntax: INST "DCM instance name"
   CLKIN_PERIOD=X ns;
