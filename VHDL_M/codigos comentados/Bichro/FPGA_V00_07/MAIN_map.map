WARNING:Timing:3159 - The DCM, DCM_CLKGEN_inst, has the attribute DFS_OSCILLATOR_MODE not set to PHASE_FREQ_LOCK. No phase relationship
   exists between the input clock and CLKFX or CLKFX180 outputs of this DCM. Data paths between these clock domains must be constrained
   using FROM/TO constraints.

Phase 2.7  Design Feasibility Check
WARNING:Place:1206 - This design contains a global buffer instance, <BUFG_1u>,
   driving the net, <ADC2_SCLK_OBUF>, that is driving the following (first 30)
   non-clock load pins off chip.
   < PIN: ADC1_SCLK.O; >
   < PIN: ADC2_SCLK.O; >
   This design practice, in Spartan-6, can lead to an unroutable situation due
   to limitations in the global routing. If the design does route there may be
   excessive delay or skew on this net. It is recommended to use a Clock
   Forwarding technique to create a reliable and repeatable low skew solution:
   instantiate an ODDR2 component; tie the .D0 pin to Logic1; tie the .D1 pin to
   Logic0; tie the clock net to be forwarded to .C0; tie the inverted clock to
   .C1. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was
   applied on COMP.PIN <BUFG_1u.O> allowing your design to continue. This
   constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN.
WARNING:Place:1137 - This design is not guaranteed to be routable! This design
   contains a global buffer instance, <BUFG_1u>, driving the net,
   <ADC2_SCLK_OBUF>, that is driving the following (first 30) non-clock load
   pins.
   < PIN: lut11028_351.A4; >
   < PIN: ADC1_SCLK.O; >
   < PIN: ADC2_SCLK.O; >
   This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in
   the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable
   situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock
   loads. Please pay extra attention to the timing and routing of this path to
   ensure the design goals are met. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <BUFG_1u.O> allowing
   your design to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules
   related to the specified COMP.PIN.

Phase 4.2  Initial Placement for Architecture Specific Features

......
WARNING:Place:1109 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <RSINC2> is placed at site <E11>. The corresponding BUFG
   component <TEST_2_OBUF_BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X2Y9>. There is only
   a select set of IOBs that can use the fast path to the Clocker buffer, and
   they are not being used. You may want to analyze why this problem exists and
   correct it. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE
   constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <RSINC2.PAD> allowing your design to
   continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the
   specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may
   lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition
   be corrected in the design.

  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
